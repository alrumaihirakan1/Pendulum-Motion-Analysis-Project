This project consisted creating a programme that used motion tracking software for the motion of a pendulum as it swung. 
The code takes in the x and y positions of the pendulum and analyses them, giving insightful properties of the pendulum like the string length and period.
By inserting pendulum motion tracking videos to the programme, it will produce occilation graphs with timed motion, and provide a realisitc estimate of the pendulum properties.
